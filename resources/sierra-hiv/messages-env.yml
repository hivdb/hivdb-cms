max-mixture-rate-dropdown-desc: >-
  Choose a threshold that limits the proportion of allowed nucleotide mixtures
  across the genome (after the minimum read depth is applied). The default
  threshold is 2% (~17 mixtures in Envelope). 

no-mutations-found: >-
  No known drug resistance mutations were found in this sequence.
