  HIVseq Program: Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIVseq accepts user-submitted RT, protease, and integrase sequences or
  mutations. Translated sequences are compared to the consensus subtype B
  reference sequence and the differences are used as query parameters for
  interrogating the HIV Drug Resistance Database to determine the prevalence of
  each mutation in antiretroviral class naïve or experienced patients with
  viruses belonging to subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG. A
  detailed description of the program output can be found in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  Protease, RT, and integrase mutations can be entered using either the text
  box or auto-suggestion boxes. To use the text box, type each mutation
  separated by one or more spaces. The consensus wildtype and separating commas
  are optional. If there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a
  position, write both amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional).
  Insertions should be indicated by “Insertion” and deletions by “Deletion”.

  detailed description of the program output can be found in the [Release

  Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is entered.
  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple sequences are
  entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded using the File
  Upload option. The upper limit is currently 1000 sequences containing 3000
  nucleotides per sequence.

  The program output will contain an HTML page with a navigation sidebar
  linking to the results for each sequence. Detailed descriptions of the HTML
  and spreadsheet output are explained in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  [AAVF files](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table) generated
  by the [HYDRA pipeline](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table)
  are accepted.
