  HIVseq Program: Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIVseq accepts user-submitted RT, protease, and integrase sequences or
  mutations. Translated sequences are compared to the consensus subtype B
  reference sequence and the differences are used as query parameters for
  interrogating the HIV Drug Resistance Database to determine the prevalence of
  each mutation in antiretroviral class naïve or experienced patients with
  viruses belonging to subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG. A
  detailed description of the program output can be found in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  Protease, RT, and integrase mutations can be entered using either the text
  box or auto-suggestion boxes. To use the text box, type each mutation
  separated by one or more spaces. The consensus wildtype and separating commas
  are optional. If there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a
  position, write both amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional).
  Insertions should be indicated by “Insertion” and deletions by “Deletion”.

  Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is entered.
  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple sequences are
  entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded using the File
  Upload option. The upper limit is currently 1000 sequences containing 3000
  nucleotides per sequence.

  The program output will contain an HTML page with a navigation sidebar
  linking to the results for each sequence. Detailed descriptions of the HTML
  and spreadsheet output are explained in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  HIVseq Program: Sequence Reads (NGS) Analysis Report

seqreads-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIVseq-NGS accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and/or integrase [codon
  frequency tables (CodFreq
  files)](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table) or [AAVF
  files](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table) generated by the
  [HYDRA pipeline](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table).
  Results are returned at 8 mutation detection thresholds. At each threshold
  the program quantifies the number of [unusual
  mutations](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#multi-threshold.mutation.summary.table)
  and the number of [signature APOBEC
  mutations](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#multi-threshold.mutation.summary.table).
  Thresholds with large numbers of unusual or signature APOBEC mutations are
  likely too low and pose unacceptable risks of identifying artifactual
  mutations caused either by machine error, PCR error, or G-to-A hypermutation.

  By default, genotypic resistance interpretations are returned for the 20%
  threshold. A drop-down menu allows users to view results at lower thresholds.
  A multi-threshold mutation summary table is provided to help users identify
  thresholds to reduce the risk of identifying artifactual mutations. Genotypic
  resistance interpretations are suppressed at thresholds for which >1% of
  positions have an unusual mutation. The appropriate mutation detection
  threshold, however, cannot be identified with certainty in the absence of a
  sequencing protocol that uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for each
  virus template.

  Mutations detected at low thresholds are difficult to interpret because they
  are at increased risk of being artifactual and because few data have linked
  such mutations with an increased risk of virological failure to contemporary
  ART regimens. Nonetheless, the genotypic resistance interpretation of
  HIVdb-NGS beta version currently does not consider the threshold at which a
  mutation is detected. Like the main HIVdb program, the purpose of HIVdb-NGS
  beta is educational with regard to its genotypic resistance interpretations
  and quality control analysis.
