  HIValg Program: Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIValg compares HIVdb results to those of 2 other algorithms: i. Rega
  Institute ([rules](http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/)), and ii. Agence Nationale
  de Recherches sur le SIDA (ANRS
  [rules](http://www.hivfrenchresistance.org/)). However, it does not provide
  the complete HIVdb report. HIValg also allows users to interpret sequences
  using any algorithm created using the [Algorithm Specification Interface
  (ASI)](/page/asi/). A detailed description of the program as well as all
  updates can be found in the [Release Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  Protease, RT, and integrase mutations can be entered using either the text
  box or auto-suggestion boxes. To use the text box, type each mutation
  separated by one or more spaces. The consensus wildtype and separating commas
  are optional. If there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a
  position, write both amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional).
  Insertions should be indicated by “Insertion” and deletions by “Deletion”.

  updates can be found in the [Release Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is entered.
  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple sequences are
  entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded using the File
  Upload option. The upper limit is currently 1000 sequences containing 3000
  nucleotides per sequence.

  The program output will contain an HTML page with a navigation sidebar
  linking to the results for each sequence. Detailed descriptions of the HTML
  and spreadsheet output are explained in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  are accepted.
