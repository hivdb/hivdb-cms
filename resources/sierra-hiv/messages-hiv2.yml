  HIV-2 Sequence Analysis Report

sequence-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIVdb for HIV-2 (beta) accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and integrase
  HIV-2 sequences. Its purpose is educational and as such it provides mutation
  classification and extensive comments.

  Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is entered.
  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple sequences are
  entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded using the File
  Upload option. For better performance, we recommend users to submit less than
  1000 sequences (about 3000 nucleotides per sequence) per request.

  By default the program output will contain an HTML page with a navigation
  sidebar linking to the results for each sequence. Users selecting the
  spreadsheet output options, will obtain links to tab-delimited files
  containing tabular sequence summary data, tabular resistance summary data,
  and a formatted amino acid sequence alignment. HTML and spreadsheet output
  are explained in the [Release Notes](/page/release-notes/).
