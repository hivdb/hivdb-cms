  HIV-1 Mutations Analysis Report

  HIVdb accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and integrase sequences or
  mutations and returns inferred levels of resistance to the most commonly used
  protease, nucleoside, non-nucleoside, and integrase inhibitors. Its purpose
  is educational and as such it provides extensive comments and a highly
  transparent scoring system that is hyperlinked to data in the HIV Drug
  Resistance Database. A detailed description of the program as well as all
  updates is in the [Release Notes](/page/release-notes/). A [web
  service](/page/webservice/) has been created to allow users to access HIVdb
  programmatically.

  <strong style="color:rgb(140,21,21);">New: this program is now available for
  [analyzing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, FASTA, and FASTQ (NGS)
  sequences.](https://covdb.stanford.edu/sierra/sars2/by-patterns/)</strong>

  Protease, RT, and integrase mutations can be entered using either the text
  box or auto-suggestion boxes. To use the text box, type each mutation
  separated by one or more spaces. The consensus wildtype and separating commas
  are optional. If there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a
  position, write both amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional).
  Insertions should be indicated by “Insertion” and deletions by “Deletion”.

  sequences.](https://covdb.stanford.edu/sierra/sars2/by-patterns/)</strong>

  Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is entered.
  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple sequences are
  entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded using the File
  Upload option. The upper limit is currently 1000 sequences containing 3000
  nucleotides per sequence.

  By default the program output will contain an HTML page with a navigation
  sidebar linking to the results for each sequence. Users selecting the
  spreadsheet output options, will obtain links to tab-delimited files
  containing tabular sequence summary data, tabular resistance summary data,
  and a formatted amino acid sequence alignment. Detailed descriptions of the
  HTML and spreadsheet output are explained in the [Release
  Notes](/page/release-notes/).

  HIV-1 Sequence Reads (NGS) Analysis Report

seqreads-analysis-form-desc: |-
  HIVdb-NGS (beta) accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and/or integrase [codon
  frequency tables (CodFreq
  files)](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table) or [AAVF
  files](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table) generated by the
  [HYDRA pipeline](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#codon.frequency.table).
  Results are returned at 8 mutation detection thresholds. At each threshold
  the program quantifies the number of [unusual
  mutations](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#multi-threshold.mutation.summary.table)
  and the number of [signature APOBEC
  mutations](/page/hivdb-ngs-release-notes/#multi-threshold.mutation.summary.table).
  Thresholds with large numbers of unusual or signature APOBEC mutations are
  likely too low and pose unacceptable risks of identifying artifactual
  mutations caused either by machine error, PCR error, or G-to-A hypermutation.

  By default, genotypic resistance interpretations are returned for the 20%
  threshold. A drop-down menu allows users to view results at lower thresholds.
  A multi-threshold mutation summary table is provided to help users identify
  thresholds to reduce the risk of identifying artifactual mutations. Genotypic
  resistance interpretations are suppressed at thresholds for which >1% of
  positions have an unusual mutation. The appropriate mutation detection
  threshold, however, cannot be identified with certainty in the absence of a
  sequencing protocol that uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for each
  virus template.

  Mutations detected at low thresholds are difficult to interpret because they
  are at increased risk of being artifactual and because few data have linked
  such mutations with an increased risk of virological failure to contemporary
  ART regimens. Nonetheless, the genotypic resistance interpretation of
  HIVdb-NGS beta version currently does not consider the threshold at which a
  mutation is detected. Like the main HIVdb program, the purpose of HIVdb-NGS
  beta is educational with regard to its genotypic resistance interpretations
  and quality control analysis.

  HIV-1 NGS Pipeline **converts FASTQ files into codon frequency tables
  (CodFreq files)**. The pipeline first aligns FASTQ files using MINIMAP2. It
  then extracts codon frequency tables from the output SAM files.

  Minimal example of a CodFreq file:

  | gene | position | totalReads | codon | reads |
