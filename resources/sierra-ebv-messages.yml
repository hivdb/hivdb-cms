  Sudan Ebolavirus Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  Mutations of each SEV gene, NP, VP35, VP40, GP, sGP, ssGP, VP30, VP24, and L,
  can be entered using the text box. To use the text box, type or paste
  mutations separated by one or more spaces. The mutation should start with its
  gene's name and a colon followed. The reference wildtype and separating
  commas are optional. If there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a
  position, write both amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional).
  Insertions should be indicated by “ins” and deletions by “del”.

  Sudan Ebolavirus Sequence Analysis Report

sequence-analysis-form-desc: |-
  Sudan Ebolavirus Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence
  is entered.  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple
  sequences are entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded
  using the File Upload option. The upper limit is currently 100 sequences
  containing ~20000 nucleotides per sequence. The input sequences will be
  aligned to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1
  ([NC_006432.1](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cms.hivdb.org/prod/downloads/NC_006432.1.fas)).
  The report provides lineage/variant, mutations, quality assessment, drug
  resistance comments and susceptibility summary.

  Sudan Ebolavirus Sequence Reads (NGS) Analysis Report

seqreads-analysis-form-desc: |-
  Sudan Ebolavirus Sequence Reads of each Sudan Ebolavirus gene, NP, VP35,
  VP40, GP, sGP, ssGP, VP30, VP24, and L, can be submittted in the form of
  [codon frequency tables (CodFreq files)](/page/codfreq/).

  We provide a pipeline for directly aligning FASTQ files and generating
  CodFreq tables from the MINIMAP2 alignments. To use this pipeline, just add
  the .fastq or .fastq.gz files to the below input form. By clicking the "Start
  process" button, the program will automatically start the FASTQ pipeline,
  upload your FASTQ files to our server. Once the pipeline is finished, buttons
  for downloading the CodFreq tables or directly running the analysis will
  appear.

  For submitted FASTQ files, please note that these files will be stored for
  two weeks for quality control purposes in the event that questions arise
  regarding the manner in which the codon frequency file is produced.

ngs2codfreq-form-desc: |-
  Sudan Ebolavirus NGS Pipeline **converts FASTQ files into codon frequency tables
  (CodFreq files)**. The pipeline first aligns FASTQ files using MINIMAP2. It
  then extracts codon frequency tables from the output SAM files.

  Please upload a Sudan Ebolavirus primer FASTA file or enter Sudan Ebolavirus primer
  sequences. Keywords are used to identify directionality from each sequence
  header:

  - 5′ end only keywords: foward, left, fwd, 5-end
  - 3′ end only keywords: backward, reverse, right, bwd, rev, rvs, 3-end
  - Others are identified as 5′ and 3’ end
