## Phylogenetic tree

Sequences were selected by larger than 98% coverage of the gene, because the number of sequences is too large, we chose two sequences per combination of (Host, Sample Year, and Country). Each sequence was aligned to the reference nucleic acid sequence using Viral MSA with Minimap2. IQTree2 was used to create a maximum likelihood tree using a general time reversible + gamma distribution. The R library ggtree was used to draw the figures.
